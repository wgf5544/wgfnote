# 脚本

### 一、准备

* [获得cleaner.jar](https://github.com/sunnyandgood/BigData/blob/master/脚本-定时器/cleaner.jar)

* 上传

### 二、执行脚本

* 执行a1.sh脚本

     * a1.sh脚本的内容

            /softWare/hadoop-2.2.0/bin/hadoop jar /cleaner.jar /flume/$CURRENT /cleaned/$CURRENT

     * 执行a1.sh脚本
     
           # chmod +x a1.sh
           # ./a1.sh

* 执行a2.sh脚本

    * 创建外部分区表
    
            create external table wxkj(ip string,time string,urls string) partitioned by (logdate string) 
                                        row format delimited fields terminated by '\t' location '/cleaned';
